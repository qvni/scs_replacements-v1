Compatibility: EET (should be compatible with BG1EE, BG2EE, however it isn't tested)

Requirements: SCS v33.6, do NOT install with later versions or earlier versions. Must be installed AFTER SCS is extracted into the game install directory, but BEFORE running the setup-stratagems.exe. This ideally should be paired with misc_ex as it was designed to be installed together, misc_ex should be installed AFTER SCS.

	BEFORE INSTALLING
	
		> Make a backup of the original stratagems folder, somewhere other than the installation directory.
		> After the mod is installed, the stratagems folder located in the installation directory will be the modified version of SCS.
	
	Installation Order:
	
	- SCS extracted to install directory.
	- scs_replacements installed.
	- SCS installed.
	- misc_ex installled.
	
	Project Infinity:
	
	- Move the stratagems mod folder into installation directory.
	- Extract scs_replacements into installation directory.
	- Run setup-scs_replacements.exe.
	- Copy the stratagems folder back into Project Infinity mod directory folder.
	- Project Infinity will now use the altered version of SCS.
